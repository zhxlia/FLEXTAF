Verify the consistency between the table and the utterance with "True" or "False" using python code.
You should generate a function with the following signature without any other parameters: 
Here are some demonstrations you may refer to, and you don't need to answer the demonstrations:

Based on the above demonstrationsï¼ŒVerify the consistency between the following table and utterance.

table = <table>
utterance: <utterance>
